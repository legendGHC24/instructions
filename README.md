# Getting started

1. Get copilot access - Add your github handle to this page:
2. Get VSCode - https://code.visualstudio.com/download
   For Mac - Go to About this mac - check your chip. For me, it was Apple Chip and I downloaded .zip in a new folder called "legendghc24". Double clicked to finally get VSCode started.   
3. Go to Extensions in VSCode, search and install following:
      (i)  Legend under FINOS - Legend Language Support (parse, compile, execute)
      (ii) Github Copilot - Install and sign in to your github. Sign in with the github handle you provided in Step 1. Once signed in, you will automatically get access to copilot via organisation legendGHC24.
4. Make sure versions of following are correct -
     (i) 
5. Clone this repository in the same folder "legendghc24" - https://github.com/legendGHC24/instructions.git
6. Make sure that .pure file is getting parsed by Legend Compiler (meaning, the color of code changes and code lens commands are visible)
